## Another docs page. More of the same!

Again, I'm afraid that there is no real documentation here. This is just another example page. It's not that I don't think that documentation is important, it's just that it ia hard to write well, and this is only for use an example.

Want to see some proper docs? You should see the [documentation on Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/docs). It's yummy.

For information about how this works, or to try it for yourself by cloning this code repository and setting up your own test site in a few short clicks, take a look at the [about](/about) page.
