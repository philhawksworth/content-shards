## This could be documentation, but it's all for show

This is a page int eh [docs](/docs) section of thr site. It could describe how the site works, hope to build it yourself, how to configure things... but it doesn't.

This is just an example. It represents what might appear in a documentation section of a site. Or indeed any section of a site which might contain lots of content which you don't need to refresh with every build of the site as content elsewhere updates.

For information about how this works, or to try it for yourself by cloning this code repository and setting up your own test site in a few short clicks, take a look at the [about](/about) page.
