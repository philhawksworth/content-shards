## Another news page.

This is another news page. But it holds no real news since it is just an example.

One bit of news is that you should be able to notice that the date this page was most recently generated is likely to be more recent than that of the pages found in the [docs](/docs) section. That is because this site is a proof of concept to explore sharding the site generation of [JAMstack](https://www.jamstack.org) site on Netlify to better make use of build caching mechanics.

For information about how this works, or to try it for yourself by cloning this code repository and setting up your own test site in a few short clicks, take a look at the [about](/about) page.
