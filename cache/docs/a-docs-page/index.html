<p>There's not much here in the sample post page. Better get to work.</p>
<p>The common front-matter data for all of the files in the posts section are abstracted into a <code>posts.json</code> file so that we don't need to repeat that on every file. Handy.</p>
<p>It looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>{
  &quot;layout&quot; : &quot;layouts/post.md&quot;,
  &quot;tags&quot; : &quot;post&quot;,
  &quot;templateEngineOverride&quot;: &quot;njk,md&quot;
}
</code></pre>
